AIRCRAFT PROJECT
Determining the safest Airplanes to Invest in Business

Context of Business
Before making any purchases, our company, which is new to the aviation sector, wants to know which aircraft types are the least risky. The objective is to reduce the likelihood of deadly mishaps and guarantee safer operations for both residential and commercial applications.

Approach
We will examine the Kaggle aviation accident dataset (1919–2023) in order to determine which planes have the least danger. Our primary precautions will be:

The percentage of fatal accidents that occurred in each type of aircraft is known as the fatal accident percentage.

Total fatalities by type of aircraft: the total effect of each model's accidents.

Both the probability of a fatal crash and its severity will be displayed by these measurements.

Safety Considerations to Look Into
In addition to aircraft type, we will investigate:

The time of accidents (by year, decade, and perhaps time of day).

Location of accidents (country, region).

Who is in charge of the aircraft—the military, private operators, or commercial airlines?

Which types of accidents happen (according to accident categories).

Anticipated Result
We will offer a transparent, data-driven ranking of aircraft types by risk level by integrating these information. This will enable the new aviation division to identify the factors that increase risk the greatest and choose aircraft models that have historically been safer with confidence.
