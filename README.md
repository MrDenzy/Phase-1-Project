**Project 1**


**Finding Aircraft with Low Risk for Business Growth**

**INTRODUCTION:**
Context of Business: Before making any purchases, our company, which is new to the aviation sector, wants to know which aircraft types are the least risky. The objective is to reduce the likelihood of deadly mishaps and guarantee safer operations for both residential and commercial applications. Evaluation of Kaggle aviation accident dataset (1919â€“2023).

**A. BUSINESS QUESTIONS**

Total fatalities by type of aircraft: the total effect of each model's accidents.

Location of Accidents by country

The time of accidents.

**Anticipated Result:** I will offer a transparent, data-driven ranking of aircraft types by risk level by integrating these information. This will enable the new aviation division to identify the factors that increase risk the greatest and choose aircraft models that have historically been safer with confidence.

**Final Summary of Business**
Our study of aviation accident data from 1919 to 2023 shows that modern commercial aircraft like the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 families are the safest to invest in. Compared to older planes like the Douglas DC-3 or Antonov series, which are responsible for a lot of historical accidents, these models have a lot fewer deaths. Also, the fact that accidents have been going down steadily since the 1980s shows that technology, regulatory oversight, and safety protocols have all gotten better and are now built into newer planes.

The safest course of action for the company's aviation debut is to make investments in contemporary business jets for either private and business use and steer clear of antiquated models with a high accident rate. Further lowering risk exposure will come from operating mostly in areas like Western European countries and North America that have strict aviation safety regulations. The business can confidently expand its airline portfolio while protecting passengers and operations by concentrating on dependable aircraft families with established safety records
