# Phase-1-Project
# Finding Aircraft with Low Risk for Business Growth.

# **OVERVIEW**

In order to determine which aircraft types are the safest for possible investment, this project examines aviation accident data from 1919 to 2023. Our company's expansion into the aviation industry presents a business challenge: lowering risk exposure when selecting aircraft for both business and private operations. We cleaned and examined accident records utilizing the Kaggle airplane accident dataset, paying particular attention to time trends, aircraft types, fatalities, and accident locations. We can now make data-driven recommendations about which aircraft types are the least risky because the results clearly show differences in safety performance across plane makes and categories.

# **BUSINESS PROBLEM**

The company wants to get into the aviation business, but it doesn't know anything about the risks of accidents. To make smart choices about which planes to use for business and personal use, we need to find out which models have had the fewest fatal accidents in the past.
The company specifically seeks responses to the following questions:

1. Which kinds of airplanes have the most and least fatalities overall?

2. Which countries have the highest accident rates?

3. What are the decades-long trends in accident rates?

The newly created air travel division can put safer aircraft models at the top of its list of priorities, lower operational risks, protect investments, and build trust between clients and passengers by dealing with these problems.

# **Data Understanding**

The Aviation Accident Data (1919â€“2023) dataset is sourced from Kaggle, which aggregates global aviation accident data. A single accident event is represented by each row, which includes information like:

1. The accident date - useful in order of extracting the year and decade

2. Aircraft type - risk comparison

3. Operator - private or commercial

4. Fatalities - variable for risk assessment

5. location of accident

6. Accident category (cat)

Since reducing fatal accidents is the company's top priority, fatalities are our target variable. Important context for comprehending trends and safety performance is provided by additional variables such as plane type, provider type, country, and year.

# **Final Summary of Business**

Our study of aviation accident data from 1919 to 2023 shows that modern commercial aircraft like the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 families are the safest to invest in. Compared to older planes like the Douglas DC-3 or Antonov series, which are responsible for a lot of historical accidents, these models have a lot fewer deaths. Also, the fact that accidents have been going down steadily since the 1980s shows that technology, regulatory oversight, and safety protocols have all gotten better and are now built into newer planes.

The safest course of action for the company's aviation debut is to make investments in contemporary business jets for either private and business use and steer clear of antiquated models with a high accident rate. Further lowering risk exposure will come from operating mostly in areas like Western European countries and North America that have strict aviation safety regulations. The business can confidently expand its airline portfolio while protecting passengers and operations by concentrating on dependable aircraft families with established safety records.
